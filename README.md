# DocWeave

DocWeave is a human-governed multi-agent document-management system for the
CockroachDB x AWS Hackathon — Build with Agentic Memory.

The product is designed to discover large PDF collections, classify documents,
propose meaningful names and destinations, identify related records, execute
approved copy or move operations, and safely restore prior states. CockroachDB
is the persistent operational, semantic, episodic, and preference memory. The
complete judged product will run on Amazon Web Services.

## Current status

DocWeave is in the approved requirements phase. No application implementation,
database schema, or AWS infrastructure is claimed yet.

The current approved product direction includes:

- a complete PySide6 desktop application for authorized Windows folders;
- a complete cloud application using the same production agentic core;
- discovery of up to 10,000 files;
- up to 5,000 actively managed documents per Minimum Viable Product project;
- resumable processing batches of up to 1,000 documents;
- a representative demonstration corpus of approximately 300 synthetic PDFs;
- confidence-driven human review and high-confidence quality sampling;
- safe copy, move, and restore operations with append-only history;
- complete attribution for operators, reviewers, agents, and project managers;
- a relational-first CockroachDB design with meaningful vector retrieval.
